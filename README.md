# zoop-rofi ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you _really_ want to respond to a message with a sequence of dumb emojis, 
but by the time you finally type it out, the moment has passed and you come off as some kind of out-of-touch weirdo? ðŸ˜”

Fret not.

A [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) based tool to easily allow you to paste your favorite emoji sequences.

Search for what you need from a user-defined list. The selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. ðŸª„

Easily configurable using Lispy S-expressions. ðŸ¤©

```lisp
(((name . "ðŸ‘‰ðŸ˜ŽðŸ‘‰") (aliases "zoop" "fingerguns")))
```

The tool automatically generates a template config on startup in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zoop-rofi/`


## Why?

This tool serves several purposes:

* A way for me to learn Rust ðŸ¦€
* A way to allow a 30-something millennial to cling to youth juuust a bit longer, by providing him easy access to Cool Emojis (tm) ðŸ˜Ž

## System dependencies

* [`rofi`](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
* `xclip`/`xsel`

## TODO

* Clean up implementation
* Build binaries
